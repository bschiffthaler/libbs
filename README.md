# libbs - Just another C++ utility library

## Building

Any C++11 capable compiler should do. Tested with `clang++ 7` and `g++ 8`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bschiffthaler/libbs
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Testing

After building, you can run the unit tests (if you want)

```bash
make test
```
